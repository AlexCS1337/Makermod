Function
	R_AddMD3Surfaces

line 365
	shader = tr.shaders[ md3Shader->shaderIndex ];



Concept:
	Make it pick another shader by using a different index number.

Method:
	Introduce a new global array, each element represents the player who has that ID.
	The array contains info on what has been remapped.

	function: R_AddEntitySurfaces
	line 1339: tr.currentModel = R_GetModelByHandle( ent->e.hModel );

	If the player has remapped anything on this model, it detects that after this line.
	Using either model name or index, most likely index. 
	And tags another global variable to use new method.

	In R_AddEntitySurfaces it goes through entities to render them.
	RT_MODEL is the ent->e.reType this is needed for.

	Before line 364, enter new method if it has been discovered to be active.
	Replace index with new one from selected global array.
