# Makermod
Makermod is a Star Wars Jedi Knight : Jedi Academy modification that allows players to place model and effect assets from the game in the world, as well as some modifications to the saber system.

Makermod was created by Toast, and the code was later passed on to me (Scooper). Where I continued with bugfixes and development of new features. Having makermod as a project to work on, and being a part of a great coding community in Jedi Academy, has had a huge impact on my life. I got interested in game programming, and started working in the game industry because of how much fun I had had with developing makermod and working with other jacoders.

But it's time to release the code as-is. Since over the last few years it's become very clear that I will not be working any further on it. I never got around to doing my long-planned "proper" release of the source code, where I would do some cleanup and make it more presentable for public eyes. Neither Toast or me show any good programming style in this project. In my own case I blame how inexperienced I was. So be warned, the code is a mess.

# Disclaimer
The code is released as-is, I made sure it compiles on windows and functions, but that's about it. 

# License
The Makermod specific code is released under the MIT license.
